to compile :
     download all files in a single folder
     and run make.
     
to run :
     ./a.out
     
     
what it is :
    You can get any no. of available continous ID (int) from an allocator.
    You can save an id in an allocator.
    
    You can create an allocator.
    
    
what is advantage :
     it will always give id in optimal way.
     For example if available ids are : (4-100) and (56-58) and you ask for 2 continuous id,
     then it will give : 56 , 57 .
     ( So that always longer range is saved ).
